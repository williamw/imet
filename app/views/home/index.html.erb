<p><strong>iMet is a physical-to-digital gateway</strong>
	<br/>to help you bridge the gap between meeting
	people and getting to know them.</p>

<p>This app is a proof of concept, <a href="https://twitter.com/billw">that I built</a> in 2011 and remains largely untouched since then. It was <a href="https://github.com/williamw/imet/pull/1">resurrected in 2016</a> and lives on thanks to the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/wontruefree">Jack Thorne</a>.</p>
